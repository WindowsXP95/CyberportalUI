Cyberportal OS is/was a pretend operating system [on scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/237030105/) that aimed to have a early 2000s looking interface, inspired by old versions of MacOS and AmigaOS. This repository contains themes that give your linux desktop the same look and feel of the original Cyberportal project.

What It includes

- A Cinnamon Theme
- Partial Gnome support
- Fully themed Metacity
- An Fresh looking icon pack
- Cyberportal wallpapers and sounds
- And way more...

This project is still in its alpha stage (and is now on hold to focus on my main project)
